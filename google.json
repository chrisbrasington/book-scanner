        "description": "From the New York Times bestselling author of I Was Anastasia and The Frozen River comes a \u201cgenuinely surprising whodunit\u201d (USA Today) that tantalizingly reimagines a scandalous murder mystery that rocked the nation. One summer night in 1930, Judge Joseph Crater steps into a New York City cab and is never heard from again. Behind this great man are three women, each with her own tale to tell: Stella, his fashionable wife, the picture of propriety; Maria, their steadfast maid, indebted to the judge; and Ritzi, his showgirl mistress, willing to seize any chance to break out of the chorus line. As the twisted truth emerges, Ariel Lawhon\u2019s wickedly entertaining debut mystery transports us into the smoky jazz clubs, the seedy backstage dressing rooms, and the shadowy streets beneath the Art Deco skyline. Don't miss Ariel Lawhon's new book, The Frozen River!",

        "description": "From the bestselling author of The Frozen River comes an enthralling historical mystery that unravels the extraordinary twists and turns in Anna Anderson\u2019s fifty-year battle to be recognised as Anastasia Romanov. Is she the Russian grand duchess or the thief of another woman\u2019s legacy? Countless others have rendered their verdict. Now it is your turn. Russia, 1918: Under direct orders from Vladimir Lenin, Bolshevik secret police herd Anastasia Romanov, along with the entire imperial family, into a damp basement in Siberia, where they face a merciless firing squad. None survive. At least that is what the executioners have always claimed. Germany, 1920: A young woman bearing an uncanny resemblance to Anastasia Romanov is pulled shivering and senseless from a canal. Refusing to explain her presence in the freezing water or even acknowledge her rescuers, Anna Anderson is taken to the hospital where an examination reveals that her body is riddled with countless horrific scars. When she finally does speak, this frightened, mysterious young woman claims to be the Russian grand duchess. As rumours begin to circulate that the youngest Romanov daughter survived the massacre, old enemies and new threats awaken. I Was Anastasia unravels the thrilling mystery around Anna Anderson in a tale that is every bit as moving and momentous as it is harrowing and twisted.",

Her quest for survival through the Cambodian jungle eventually led her to a boat that took her to Thailand and an orphanage where Nhi lived for two years until she qualified for refugee status in the United States. Years later, she returned to Vietnam with a film producer to reunite with the family she never thought she\u2019d see again. A second trip to Vietnam brought her two mothers, birth and adopted, face to face. Yet Soles of a Survivor isn\u2019t just another inspirational survival story. It\u2019s about the lessons Nhi learned about humanity, diversity, and unconditional love since arriving in the United States. She now has a deeper appreciation for the parallels between the Jewish and Vietnamese cultures, and others. After she met her Jewish beau, they got married. She eventually converted to Judaism, though the process was challenging for an Asian woman adopted into a Christian household. Her story shows it matters less what religion we\u2019re part of, as long as we radiate goodness to those we meet. Now she relishes being a Vietnamese Jew. Having come full circle from prosperity to poverty and back, Nhi hopes to encourage others to believe that in spite of overwhelming odds, all things are possible if one has an intense desire, focused energy, and the audacity to grasp presented opportunities.",

In this barren place, they are swept into the rogue wave of change, a love triangle and a tragic accident. Shoal water is a treacherous place. Not out on the deep water, and not on land, it's in a place in between, full of unexpected hazards-submerged sandbars, diffracted waves, counter currents. Shoal Water is also the unflinching account of a woman's passage out of dependence into self-possession as she navigates dangerous waters and gains the power to redeem loss and find forgiveness.",
