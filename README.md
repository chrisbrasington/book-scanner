# Book Scanner Lookup Script & CSV database

This Python script allows you to search for book metadata using either ISBN (ISBN-13 or ISBN-10) or a title-author pair. It retrieves information from Open Library and Google Books, then stores results in a CSV file.

## Barcode Scanner Keyboard Wedge

To streamline ISBN entry, you can use a barcode scanner keyboard wedge app on your phone. This allows barcode scans to be input directly into the script as if typed.

### Recommended App

**[QR Scanner Keyboard (by AppGround)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.appground.blek&hl=en-US)**  
A reliable Android app that emulates scanned barcodes as keyboard input.

- Supports ISBN-13 and ISBN-10 barcodes
- Works over Bluetooth, USB, or directly on-device
- Ideal for use with terminals, forms, and scripts expecting text input

> ðŸ“² Install from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.appground.blek&hl=en-US)

**Note:** Ensure your terminal window or input box is focused when scanning.

## Features

- Accepts ISBN-13 or ISBN-10

- Records results in `books.csv` with:
  - ISBN-13

  - Author
  - Publish Date
  - URL
  - Scanned Input

## Requirements

```bash
python3 scanner.py
````

Enter:

* An ISBN-13 or ISBN-10

Quit with `q`.

## Output
